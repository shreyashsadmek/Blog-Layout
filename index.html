                    <p class="blog-content">
                        <strong>What is AI?</strong><br>
                        AI refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Essentially, it involves programming computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and understanding language.
